## Setup

This project is a static HTML website. To view it locally, simply open the `index.html` file in your web browser.

For development, ensure you have a web server set up or use a simple static server like `live-server` (if installed via npm).

```bash
# To install live-server globally (if you don't have it)
npm install -g live-server

# To run with live-server
live-server
```

The Japanese version is `index.html` and the English version is `en/index.html`.

## Deployment

The portfolio can be deployed on any static site hosting service (e.g., GitHub Pages, Vercel, Netlify).
